# Heads of the W
A site that visually displays stats from the 2023 regular season WNBA games.

**To Run Locally:**
Clone this repository
`https://github.com/hannahjblair/w-heads.git`
Use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code to open in browser

**Features List:**
- Uses arrays and objects to store and retrieve information about WNBA players that are stored in my app.
- Analyzes the data that is stored in the arrays and objects and displays information about it in my app. The Players array is sorted in descending order by points and then the players heads are displayed and the size of their head is determined by their order in the array. 
- Retrive data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app. I am using (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to display images of dogs.

*Disclaimer: This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. Please come back soon to see a more polished product and more features*
